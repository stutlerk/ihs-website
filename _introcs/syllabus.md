## 2016-2017 Intro to Computer Science Syllabus

### Overview
Welcome to Introduction to Computer Science! In this class, you'll learn the basics of computer science and computer programming and develop the skills to start writing programs of your own. Don't worry if you've never programmed before; we don't require any previous experience and will teach you everything you need to know. Be prepared to move quickly and work hard all semester long, but expect to have a lot of fun too!

### Classroom Expectations

#### Student Behavior
Students are expected to act respectfully, courteously and appropriately at all times. In particular:

- Arrive on time and remain attentive until dismissed.
- Come to class with all necessary materials prepared to learn and participate.
- Do not create problems for your classmates or the instructors, and attempt to fix problems you encounter quickly and quietly.
- Do not cause distractions in the classroom.
- Be attentive and on task at all times.
- **No food in the classroom. No drinks except for water in a closed container.**
So long as it is not abused, students will be given the freedom to manage their educational experience in whatever way works best for them. Students are expected to take responsibility for their own actions and decisions, and accept the results, positive or negative, of the choices they make.

#### Professionalism
Intro to Computer Science is a **CTE** (Career and Technical Education) course, and as such, there are certain expectations that go beyond what you might have in any other class. CTE courses have a focus on _career skills_ and _professionalism_, and strive to give a _real-world_ experience. Because of this, **professionalism** is a major point of emphasis. Consider this classroom to be like a workplace: you have just been hired by a software company, and this classroom is your office. Treat your coworkers (classmates) and your managers (instructors) with the respect you would expect to show in a work environment.

#### Use of Technology
Students are allowed and encouraged to use technology in class, subject to the following rules:

- Classroom computers should be used for Intro to Computer Science-related work. In particular, you should not use the computers to check email, look at your grades, or do work for other classes **without permission from the course staff**. When given approval, students may use the computers for other academic purposes if they have completed their current assignment.Classroom computers **should never be used for playing games, accessing social media, or other non-academic activities.**
- Personal electronics (cell phones, MP3 players, etc.) are not to be used in class except in approved circumstances.
 - **Exception:** When music is playing over the classroom speakers, you may be listening to your own music if you choose. However, _it is your responsibility to ensure that you are aware of what is happening in the classroom,_ and personal music must be turned off when the classroom music goes off. I recommend only using one headphone so you can still hear.

#### Absence Policy
It is **YOUR RESPONSIBILITY** to find out what was covered on a day you were absent and make up the required work. If you do not do so in the timeline described in the student handbook (one day extension per day absent), you may be subject to penalties for late work.

### Coursework
Coursework will fall into one of two categories:

1. #### Projects/Assessments (80% of final grade)
  There will be several large projects over the course of the semester. These will usually be assigned over one week or more and will typically have graded checkpoints along the way to ensure you are making adequate progress. Significant in-class time will be provided to work on projects, but you should expect to have to do some of your work at home as well. Unless otherwise indicated, projects (including checkpoints) are due _no more than five minutes after the start of class_ on the assigned due date.

  A few tests and/or quizzes may be given at important points throughout the semester. Assessments may or may not be announced, and all assessments are closed-book and closed-notes unless otherwise indicated. Assessments must be completed within a single class period— **you will not be allowed to return to finish an assessment after school or at lunch**.

2. #### Classwork/Homework (20% of final grade)
  Whereas projects are large, multi-week assignments, classwork and homework are smaller assignments expected to be completed within a week or less. Classwork exercises are due _at the end of class_ the day they are assigned. Homework is due _at the start of class_ on the assigned due date.

### Grading
Each individual assignment will be accompanied by a rubric indicating what aspects of the assignment will be assessed and the relative values each will be given. These rubrics should provide complete information about how assignments will be graded, and as such, grades should never be too surprising. Read the rubrics carefully, and ask questions when they are published to ensure you fully understand the requirements of the assignment.

Quarter and semester grades will be computed using a process to be determined. This process will be announced as soon as it is finalized, and well in advance of the midpoint of the first grading period.

### Approximate Course Scope and Sequence (subject to change)

### Tech Prep College Connections Program
This course is _Tech Prep College Connections_ approved and articulated with Bellevue College and/or Lake Washington Institute of Technology. Students who demonstrate proficiency of the college course competencies with a 'B' (3.0) or better grade, _may__be eligible_ to earn college credit through the _Tech Prep_ program. During the (semester/year) all of the college competencies will be covered in class. Students must register online using the statewide enrollment and reporting system at [http://sers.techprepwa.org](http://sers.techprepwa.org) and also are required to pay a non-refundable $46 annual consortium fee to earn college credit through the Tech Prep College Connections program at [http://pay.techprepcc.org](http://pay.techprepcc.org). Students MUST register for Tech Prep college credit **while they are enrolled** in the high school course. We will discuss this further and set aside class time to register later in the course.
